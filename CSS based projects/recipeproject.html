                                <ol>
                                    <li>Step 1: Curdle the Milk Boil 1 liter of full cream milk in a deep pan. Once it boils, reduce the flame and add 2–3 tbsp lemon juice (or vinegar) slowly while stirring. The milk will curdle and separate into chenna (curds)
                                        and whey.</li>
                                    <li>Step 2: Strain the Chenna Pour it over a muslin cloth or fine sieve. Rinse under cold water to remove the sourness. Squeeze out excess water and hang it for 30 minutes to remove moisture.</li>
                                    <li>Step 3: Knead the Chenna Transfer the chenna to a plate and knead it for 8–10 minutes till smooth and soft. Divide and roll into small smooth balls, then flatten slightly into disc shapes.</li>
                                    <li>Step 4: Cook the Balls in Sugar Syrup In a wide pan, boil 4 cups water + 1 cup sugar to make sugar syrup. Drop the balls into the boiling syrup, cover, and cook on medium flame for 10–12 minutes until they double in
                                        size. Let them cool, then gently squeeze them to remove excess syrup (don’t break them!).

                                    </li>
                                    <li>Step 5: Prepare the Rabri Boil 1 liter full cream milk in a heavy-bottomed pan. Stir continuously and reduce the milk to about half. Add 4–6 tbsp sugar, ½ tsp cardamom powder, a few saffron strands, and chopped nuts
                                        (almonds, pistachios). Simmer for 5 more minutes and turn off the heat.</li>
                                    <li>Step 6: Combine and Chill Add the squeezed paneer balls to the warm rabri. Let them soak for at least 2–3 hours, or refrigerate for best flavor. Garnish with extra saffron and nuts before serving.</li>
